AZURE VIRTUAL NETWORK:
 Enables resources such as azure virtual machine safe.
 It balance the workload and its scalability and high availability.
 content delivery network(CDN) that get content to user in their region to minimize latency.

IPv4:
->It is a version 4 and first version of internet.
->it is one of the core protocol.
->it addresses in 32bit

IPv6:
->It is a version 6 and make communication over internet.
->it addresses 128 bit

Classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR):
-> A method for allocating IP address.
-> Used in most security groups.
-> It has two form base IP and subnet.

Public VS Private IP:

-> In private it can address in the form of (LAN) and public (Internet)
-> in Private it has some certain IP range and in Public all IP address on the internet.
-> VNET is private and it cant overlap with others.

  VNET:
-> azure takes ist four IP and last 1 IP.
-> it allows to manage and create own environment.
-> it can created into more subnets.

SUBNETS are more secure.
It is can be had network security and control through network access.

BASTION HOSTS:
-> It is used through SSH for private access.
-> It is more secured and there is arestriction to users getting in without permission.
-> it can be mostly used in Private IP.

NAT GATEWAY:
-> it is managed by AWS 
-> pay for the usage
-> it can be used by other subnet
-> no security groups to manage.
